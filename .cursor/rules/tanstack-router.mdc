Assume there is a vite plugin running that will update routTree.gen.ts when you save files that create new routes.
When saving a file with tanstack router's `createFileRoute` in it, the vite plugin will update routeTree.gen.ts.
So there is no need to update routeTree.gen.ts, the vite plugin will do it.
Ignore linting errors about createFileRoute's parameter. The linting error will disappear after a while.
